### Product Gift-Wrapping

To achieve the gift-wrapping functionality, we will create a custom solution that allows the client to fully control the gift-wrapping options. The client will be able to determine which products will have the gift-wrap functionality by adding a "Gift-wrap" tag to the product. Additionally, a setting schema option will be provided to enable or disable the gift card feature. The client will also have the option to select a gift-wrap product from the customizer, where they can choose either a free or priced gift-wrap product. Furthermore, we will provide options to set the maximum number of characters for the message and other input fields, allowing the client to fully customize the gift-wrapping experience.

The approach, as provided above, includes a detailed breakdown of each task and element required to implement the gift-wrapping functionality.

This can be achieved by:

An option to configure the character limit for each gift-wrap input field has been provided in the theme settings, allowing the client to set the desired limits.

An option to select a gift-wrap product has been provided in the theme settings. The client can choose any product, either free or priced, as the gift-wrap product.

Customers can update or remove the gift-wrapping options directly from the cart. The changes will be reflected in real-time, allowing for seamless adjustments.
